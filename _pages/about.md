<P> PhD student from <a href="https://www.miyazaki-u.ac.jp/english/" target="_blank" >University of Miyazaki</a>, Japan. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://srhumdb.miyazaki-u.ac.jp/html/653_en.html" target="_blank" >Prof. Yoshihiro Suzuki</a> of <a href="http://www.suzuki-labo.com/" target="_blank" >Suzuki-lab</a>. <br /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;"> 
My current research focuses on antibiotic-resistant problems that faced in human life and water environments. My interests are on the antibiotic resistant bacteria and their spread in wastewater treatment plants. Wastewater treatment plants are responsible for collecting and treating municipal wastewater, although with treatment process, it is difficult to completely remove antibiotic-resistant bacteria from wastewater. It also have the potential to become reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, additionally, residual resistant bacteria in the effluent have the capacity to spread resistance to receiving waters through horizontal transfer, which poses a threat to ecosystems and human health. I hope to devote all my knowledge and efforts to this meaningful work for the well-being of society.<br /></p>
<b>Key words</b>: water environment, environmental biotechnology, wastewater treatment plants, antibiotic resistance, public health
